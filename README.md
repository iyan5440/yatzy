This is our hangman game, coded in PHP, HTML, JS and CSS.
When you launch the game, you'll see something like this.
![Image of the launch screen of the game, featuring a leaderboard composed of many silly-named entries as well as many Natalies.](image.png)
At the top of the page is the title, as well as the start screen. You'll need to enter a username before you can play.

Once you're in the game, it'll look like this.![A white box at the top holds five underlines to denote the five-letter word attempting to be guessed. A smaller white placeholder box for the hanged man is next to it. Below them both is a brown keyboard with black keys.](image-2.png)
The underlines in the top box indicate your progress on the word. In this case, we can tell the word has five letters. The smaller white box on its right will hold the hanged man upon incorrect letter guesses.
When you're ready to guess, click on any letter on the keyboard. For demonstrative purposes, I'll pick E.![A similar image to above, but with the E key highlighted in red and a head now in the hanged man box.](image-3.png)
Unfortunately, E was an incorrect guess. But that's okay! We still have more guesses. For my next guess, I'll do I.![Another similar image, but with I highlighted in green and the second underline replaced with an I](image-4.png)
A correct guess! "I" was the second letter of the word.
Let's keep guessing until we either win or lose.![The word was "Zilch." A, E, and P are all highlighted in red on the keyboard. A pop-up with the message saying "You won!" is on the screen.](image-5.png)
If you win with a high enough score, your score will be added to the leaderboard.![An updated leaderboard. This game's score, 20000, has been added to the leaderboard in 5th place, with the username NATALIE.](image-6.png)
